## Hi, I'm Shahan

Ever since I was a little kid, I've been learning and coding, and this github is a culmination of all those years of effort (and the reason behind my super thick glasses ðŸ˜¢). 
Have fun checking out my projects!

In the past I've interned at @OpenAI, @Stripe, [@SideFX working on Houdini](https://www.sidefx.com/products/houdini/) and Faire, and I'm currently looking for cool FT opportunities!

Some of my favourite projects are:
My Gaussian Splatting viewer written from scratch in Rust and WebGL:

My Evoluation Simulator:
