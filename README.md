## Hi, I'm Shahan

Ever since I was a little kid, I've been learning and coding, and this github is a culmination of my years of learning (and the reason behind my super thick glasses 😢). 
Have fun checking out my projects!

<!--

Some of my favourite projects are:
My Gaussian Splatting viewer written from scratch in Rust and WebGL:

My Evoluation Simulator:
